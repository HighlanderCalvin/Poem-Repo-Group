In a world of code and pixel dreams,
Where logic bends and art redeems,
A game begins with sparks of light,
Born from the code that takes its flight.

In darkened rooms where screens aglow,
A thousand lines of text will flow.
With every bug, with every fix,
The world grows real—it's built from bits.

The heroes march, the monsters roar,
And players' hearts begin to soar,
Each challenge faced, each level gained,
Through endless loops, the vision’s framed.

A thousand hours, a thousand tries,
To make a world where magic flies,
From pixel art to shaders bright,
A universe that comes to life.

The journey’s long, the road is steep,
But in this craft, no dream is cheap.
For in the heart of every game,
Is passion’s spark, an endless flame.
